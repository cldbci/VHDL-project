LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Data[7]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Data_reg[0]/CLR, Data_reg[1]/CLR, Data_reg[2]/CLR, Data_reg[3]/CLR,
Data_reg[4]/CLR, Data_reg[5]/CLR, Data_reg[6]/CLR, Data_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell aux[7]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) aux_reg[0]/CLR, aux_reg[1]/CLR, aux_reg[2]/CLR, aux_reg[3]/CLR,
aux_reg[4]/CLR, aux_reg[5]/CLR, aux_reg[6]/CLR, aux_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
